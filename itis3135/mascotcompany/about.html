    <h2>About Interesting Capybara</h2>
    <p>Interesting Capybara was founded with one mission: make workplace safety cool (or at least not boring). Thatâ€™s when we met <strong>Safetybara,</strong> our laid-back, hard-working capybara mascot who knows his PPE and his protocols.</p>
    <p>What started as a sticker for a breakroom bulletin board turned into a whole line of safety-focused merch designed to bring smiles and safer habits to manufacturing floors, warehouses, and job sites everywhere. Because let's face it: you're more likely to remember the rules when a cartoon capybara is giving them to you.</p>
