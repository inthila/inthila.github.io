    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/" target="_blank">McMaster-Carr</a></h3>
      <p>McMaster-Carr’s site demonstrates clarity and usability. It’s focused on helping industrial professionals find and order parts quickly with ease resulting to little to no trouble.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This site illustrates excellent contrast through its minimalistic color scheme, relative font/image size, and effective whitespace. The search bar and product categories stand out clearly. Other necessary items such as contact info are also quick to find.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Each font, button, color, and layout pattern is consistent across all pages. This results in predictability and familiarity. The photographed images are also consistent and give a great sense of uniformity.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is perfectly aligned in a grid-based layout. It’s easy to look through the text and product images without strain. Nothing on this page too big or too small.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> All related content appears in the larger grid layout. The item name, price, and image are grouped closely with enough spacing to avoid clutter. Buttons that call to action are easy to spot and create a good sense of useability.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren.net</a></h3>
      <p>Arngren.net is an infamously bad example of web design. It tries to cram as many products as possible onto one page with no clear hierarchy, organization, or harmonious color schemes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Right away, it's evident that this site has very poor contrast. You can see several texts that overlaps images, and the text sizes and colors fail to natually guide the eye. It's hard to know where to look or even find what you're looking for.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The styles are inconsistent everywhere, for example the fonts, colors, layouts. It's clear there's no cohesive design system in place. The images seem to have come from numerous random sources and it's hard to tell what is being advertised.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> ALl items are placed haphazardly. There’s no grid-based layout, and many elements float around with no sort of visual connection. The random moving images at the bottom of the website make it hard for users to make the correlation between everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The sites cluttered layout with products and text clash together. There's no grouping of related items, making navigation extremely difficult. There is even a horizontal scroll being utilized that hides items at the far right of the page.</li>
      </ul>
