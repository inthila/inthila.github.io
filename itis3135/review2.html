    <h4>Evaluation Summary and Recommendations</h4>
    
    <p><strong>A. Review based on Standard Website Checklist:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Design/Contrast (3a): This is the most significant issue. The white text for the name ("ALISHA ZHAO") is placed over a very light, low-contrast background image, making it difficult to read. The placeholder text for the "About Me" section (black text on a mid-tone brown background) also suffers from low contrast. This needs correction to meet basic accessibility standards.</li>
        <li>CRAP - Contrast & Proximity (3c): The main navigation links use good contrast against the dark brown header bar. The name/tagline elements are well-grouped (Proximity). The lack of overall visual contrast for the headline text is the primary design failure point.</li>
        <li>Page Structure/Branding (4, 5, 7): The page uses a clear header, main content area, and footer (visible with "Copyright 2025"). The main heading, "ALISHA ZHAO," effectively serves as the site's brand. The site is clearly using a unique CSS for a standalone project (portfolio), which meets Item 3b.</li>
        <li>Navigation: The primary navigation links are excellent for a professional portfolio: Home, Animation Portfolio, Artwork Portfolio, Resume, Contact.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p><strong>B. Review based on Client Project Pt. 2 Requirements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content & Branding: The use of abstract, artistic imagery is highly relevant for an artist's portfolio, setting a strong visual tone. The content is focused on the individual/artist, which is appropriate for a client project with a personal brand goal.</li>
        <li>Clear Purpose: The navigation immediately establishes the purpose: displaying different types of work and providing a contact point. The "About Me" section clearly serves as the introductory content.</li>
        <li>"About Me" Section: While the use of filler text ("Lorem ipsum...") is noted, ensure the final content is professional, well-written, and clearly articulates Alisha's skills and goals as an artist.</li> <li>HTML/CSS Validation (Checklist Item 8b, 8c): Since the validation links are not visible, include a general note. Recommendation: Ensure both valid HTML and CSS links/buttons are prominently displayed, especially in the footer, and report zero errors/warnings.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p><strong>C. Additional Suggestions (Stop, Start, Continue):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stop: Stop relying on a low-opacity background image for the main text. The current approach makes the brand name unreadable. Either darken the background image significantly, or place a semi-transparent, solid color overlay behind the white text to ensure high contrast.</li>
        <li>Start: Start prioritizing the image links/previews for the two portfolio sections. On the homepage, maybe include a quick grid of 3-4 featured thumbnails to visually lead the user to the Animation Portfolio and Artwork Portfolio pages.</li>
        <li>Continue: Continue with the minimalist, high-impact design. The font choice and overall color palette (dark brown, tan, gold) are sophisticated. The footer credit ("Designed by Griffin Leventhal") is a professional touch that should be maintained.</li>
    </ul>
